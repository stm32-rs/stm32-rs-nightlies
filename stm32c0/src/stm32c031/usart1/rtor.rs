In standard mode, the RTOF flag is set if, after the last received character, no new start bit is detected for more than the RTO value. In Smartcard mode, this value is used to implement the CWT and BWT. See Smartcard chapter for more details. In the standard, the CWT/BWT measurement is done starting from the start bit of the last received character. Note: This value must only be programmed once per received character.
