///Field `PA` reader - Peripheral address It contains the base address of the peripheral data register from/to which the data is read/written. When PSIZE\[1:0\] = 01 (16 bits), bit 0 of PA\[31:0\] is ignored. Access is automatically aligned to a half-word address. When PSIZE\[1:0\] = 10 (32 bits), bits 1 and 0 of PA\[31:0\] are ignored. Access is automatically aligned to a word address. In memory-to-memory mode, this bitfield identifies the memory destination address if DIR = 1 and the memory source address if DIR = 0. In peripheral-to-peripheral mode, this bitfield identifies the peripheral destination address if DIR = 1 and the peripheral source address if DIR = 0. Note: This bitfield is set and cleared by software. It must not be written when the channel is enabled (EN = 1). It is not read-only when the channel is enabled (EN = 1).
