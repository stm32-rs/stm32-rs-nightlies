If DBL = 7 bytes and DBA = TIMx_CR1 represents the address of the byte to be transferred, the address of the transfer should be given by the following equation: (TIMx_CR1 address) + DBA + (DMA index), where DMA index = DBL In this example, 7 bytes are added to (TIMx_CR1 address) + DBA, which gives us the address from/to which the data is copied. In this case, the transfer is done to 7 registers starting from the following address: (TIMx_CR1 address) + DBA According to the configuration of the DMA Data Size, several cases may occur: If the DMA Data Size is configured in half-words, 16-bit data is transferred to each of the 7 registers. If the DMA Data Size is configured in bytes, the data is also transferred to 7 registers: the first register contains the first MSB byte, the second register, the first LSB byte and so on. So with the transfer Timer, one also has to specify the size of data transferred by DMA.
