It is cleared by software, writing 1 to the FECF bit in the USART_ICR register. When transmitting data in Smartcard mode, this bit is set when the maximum number of transmit attempts is reached without success (the card NACKs the data frame).

Note: This bit does not generate an interrupt as it appears at the same time as the RXFNE bit which itself generates an interrupt. An interrupt is generated when the NE flag is set during multi buffer communication if the EIE bit is set. Note: When the line is noise-free, the NE flag can be disabled by programming the ONEBIT bit to 1 to increase the USART tolerance to deviations (Refer to Section 26.5.8: Tolerance of the USART receiver to clock deviation on page 709).

It is cleared by a software, writing 1 to the ORECF, in the USART_ICR register. An interrupt is generated if RXFNEIE = 1 in the USART_CR1 register, or EIE = 1 in the USART_CR3 register. Note: When this bit is set, the USART_RDR register content is not lost but the shift register is overwritten. An interrupt is generated if the ORE flag is set during multi buffer communication if the EIE bit is set.

Note: If Mute mode is enabled (MME = 1), IDLE is set if the USART is not mute (RWU = 0), whatever the Mute mode selected by the WAKE bit. If RWU = 1, IDLE is not set.

Every read operation from the USART_RDR frees a location in the RXFIFO. RXFNE is cleared when the RXFIFO is empty. The RXFNE flag can also be cleared by writing 1 to the RXFRQ in the USART_RQR register. An interrupt is generated if RXFNEIE = 1 in the USART_CR1 register.

It is set by hardware when the transmission of a frame containing data is complete and when TXFE is set. An interrupt is generated if TCIE = 1 in the USART_CR1 register. TC bit is is cleared by software, by writing 1 to the TCCF in the USART_ICR register or by a write to the USART_TDR register. Note: If TE bit is reset and no transmission is on going, the TC bit is immediately set.

When the TXFIFO is full, this flag is cleared indicating that data can not be written into the USART_TDR. An interrupt is generated if the TXFNFIE bit =1 in the USART_CR1 register. Note: The TXFNF is kept reset during the flush request until TXFIFO is empty. After sending the flush request (by setting TXFRQ bit), the flag TXFNF should be checked prior to writing in TXFIFO (TXFNF and TXFE are set at the same time).

It is cleared by software, writing 1 to the RTOCF bit in the USART_ICR register. An interrupt is generated if RTOIE = 1 in the USART_CR2 register. In Smartcard mode, the timeout corresponds to the CWT or BWT timings. Note: If a time equal to the value programmed in RTOR register separates 2 characters, RTOF is not set. If this time exceeds this value + 2 sample times (2/16 or 2/8, depending on the oversampling method), RTOF flag is set. Note: The counter counts even if RE = 0 but RTOF is set only when RE = 1.
