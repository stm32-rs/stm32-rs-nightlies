Each bit, when set, enables the CEC logical address identified by the given bit position. At the end of HEADER reception, the received destination address is compared with the enabled addresses. In case of matching address, the incoming message is acknowledged and received. In case of non-matching address, the incoming message is received only in listen mode (LSTN=1), but without acknowledge sent. Broadcast messages are always received. Example: OAR = 0b000 0000 0010 0001 means that CEC acknowledges addresses 0x0 and 0x5. Consequently, each message directed to one of these addresses is received."]
