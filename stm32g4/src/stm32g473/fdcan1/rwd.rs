/**The RAM Watchdog monitors the READY output of the Message RAM. A Message RAM access starts the Message RAM Watchdog Counter with the value configured by the RWD\[WDC\] bits. The counter is reloaded with RWD\[WDC\] bits when the Message RAM signals successful completion by activating its READY output. In case there is no response from the Message RAM until the counter has counted down to 0, the counter stops and interrupt flag IR\[WDI\] bit is set. The RAM Watchdog Counter is clocked by the fdcan_pclk clock.

You can [`read`](crate::Reg::read) this register and get [`rwd::R`](R). You can [`reset`](crate::Reg::reset), [`write`](crate::Reg::write), [`write_with_zero`](crate::Reg::write_with_zero) this register using [`rwd::W`](W). You can also [`modify`](crate::Reg::modify) this register. See [API](https://docs.rs/svd2rust/#read--modify--write-api).
