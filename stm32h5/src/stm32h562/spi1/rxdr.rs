Alignment of data at I2S mode depends on DATLEN and DATFMT setting. Unused bits are read as zero when the register is read. Writing to the register is ignored. Note: DR can be accessed byte-wise (8-bit access): in this case only one data-byte is read by single access halfword-wise (16 bit access) in this case 2 data-bytes or 1 halfword-data can be read by single access word-wise (32 bit access). In this case 4 data-bytes or 2 halfword-data or word-data can be read by single access. Read access of this register less than the configured data size is forbidden.
