///Field `ST` reader - Start or Stop Transmission Command When this bit is set, transmission is placed in the Running state. The DMA checks the Transmit list at the current position for a packet to be transmitted. The DMA tries to acquire descriptor from either of the following positions: The current position in the list: this is the base address of the Transmit list set by the ETH_DMACTXDLAR register. The position at which the transmission was previously stopped If the DMA does not own the current descriptor, the transmission enters the Suspended state and the TBU bit of the ETH_DMACSR is set. The Start Transmission command is effective only when the transmission is stopped. If the command is issued before setting the ETH_DMACTXDLAR register, the DMA behavior is unpredictable. When this bit is reset, the transmission process is placed in the Stopped state after completing the transmission of the current packet. The Next Descriptor position in the Transmit list is saved, and it becomes the current position when the transmission is restarted. To change the list address, you need to program ETH_DMACTXDLAR register with a new value when this bit is reset. The new value is considered when this bit is set again. The stop transmission command is effective only when the transmission of the current packet is complete or the transmission is in the Suspended state.
