///Field `DIN` writer - Input data word A four-fold sequential write to this bitfield during the input phase results in writing a complete 128-bit block of input data to the AES peripheral. From the first to the fourth write, the corresponding data weights are \[127:96\], \[95:64\], \[63:32\], and \[31:0\]. Upon each write, the data from the 32-bit input buffer are handled by the data swap block according to the DATATYPE\[1:0\] bitfield, then written into the AES core 128-bit input buffer. The data signification of the input data block depends on the AES operating mode: - Mode 1 (encryption): plaintext - Mode 2 (key derivation): the bitfield is not used (AES_KEYRx registers used for input) - Mode 3 (decryption): ciphertext The data swap operation is described in page 1149.
