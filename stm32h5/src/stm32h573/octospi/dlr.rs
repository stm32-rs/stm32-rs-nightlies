///Field `DL` reader - 31: 0\]: Data length Number of data to be retrieved (value+1) in Indirect and Automatic status-polling modes. A value not greater than three (indicating 4 bytes) must be used for Automatic status-polling mode. All 1's in Indirect mode means undefined length, where OCTOSPI continues until the end of the memory, as defined by DEVSIZE. 0x0000_0000: 1 byte is to be transferred. 0x0000_0001: 2 bytes are to be transferred. 0x0000_0002: 3 bytes are to be transferred. 0x0000_0003: 4 bytes are to be transferred. ... 0xFFFF_FFFD: 4,294,967,294 (4G-2) bytes are to be transferred. 0xFFFF_FFFE: 4,294,967,295 (4G-1) bytes are to be transferred. 0xFFFF_FFFF: undefined length; all bytes, until the end of the external device, (as defined by DEVSIZE) are to be transferred. Continue reading indefinitely if DEVSIZE = 0x1F. DL\[0\] is stuck at 1 in dual-memory configuration (DMM = 1) even when 0 is written to this bit, thus assuring that each access transfers an even number of bytes. This field has no effect in Memory-mapped mode.
