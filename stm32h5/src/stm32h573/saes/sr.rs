It is cleared by software upon setting the RWEIF bit of the SAES_ICR register. Upon the flag setting, an interrupt is generated if enabled through the RWEIE bit of the SAES_ICR register.

When KEYSEL is different from zero the BUSY flag is automatically set by SAES. When key is loaded successfully, the BUSY flag is cleared and KEYVALID set. Upon an error, the KEIF flag of the SAES_ISR register is set, the BUSY flag cleared and KEYVALID kept at zero. When the KEIF flag is set, the application must clear it through the SAES_ICR register, otherwise KEYVALID cannot be set. See the KEIF bit description for more details.
