///Field `LINCALFACT` reader - Linearity Calibration Factor These bits are written by hardware or by software. They hold 30-bit out of the 160-bit linearity calibration factor. Once a single-ended inputs calibration is complete, they are updated by hardware with the calibration factors. Software can write these bits with a new calibration factor. If the new calibration factor is different from the current one stored into the analog ADC, it will then be applied once a new single-ended calibration is launched. Note: The software is allowed to write these bits only when ADEN=1, ADSTART=0 and JADSTART=0 (ADC is enabled and no calibration is ongoing and no conversion is ongoing).
