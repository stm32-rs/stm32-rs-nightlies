/**The FMC_PATT read/write register contains the timing information for NAND Flash memory bank. It is used for 8-bit accesses to the attribute memory space of the NAND Flash for the last address write access if the timing must differ from that of previous accesses (for Ready/Busy management, refer to Section20.8.5: NAND Flash prewait feature).
