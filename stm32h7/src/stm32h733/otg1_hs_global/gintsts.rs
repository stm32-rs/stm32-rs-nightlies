The OTG then sends a NAK response to the host. To avoid this scenario, the application can check the FetSusp interrupt in OTG_GINTSTS, which ensures that the FIFO is full before clearing a global NAK handshake. Alternatively, the application can mask the âIN token received when FIFO emptyâ interrupt when clearing a global IN NAK handshake.
