///Field `RL` reader - Watchdog counter reload value These bits are write access protected see Section23.3.6. They are written by software to define the value to be loaded in the watchdog counter each time the value 0xAAAA is written in the IWDG_KR register. The watchdog counter counts down from this value. The timeout period is a function of this value and the clock prescaler. Refer to the datasheet for the timeout information. The RVU bit in the IWDG_SR register must be reset in order to be able to change the reload value. Note: Reading this register returns the reload value from the VDD voltage domain. This value may not be up to date/valid if a write operation to this register is ongoing on this register. For this reason the value read from this register is valid only when the RVU bit in the IWDG_SR register is reset.
