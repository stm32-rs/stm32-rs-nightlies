///Field `DL` reader - Data length Number of data to be retrieved (value+1) in indirect and status-polling modes. A value no greater than 3 (indicating 4 bytes) should be used for status-polling mode. All 1s in indirect mode means undefined length, where QUADSPI will continue until the end of memory, as defined by FSIZE. 0x0000_0000: 1 byte is to be transferred 0x0000_0001: 2 bytes are to be transferred 0x0000_0002: 3 bytes are to be transferred 0x0000_0003: 4 bytes are to be transferred ... 0xFFFF_FFFD: 4,294,967,294 (4G-2) bytes are to be transferred 0xFFFF_FFFE: 4,294,967,295 (4G-1) bytes are to be transferred 0xFFFF_FFFF: undefined length -- all bytes until the end of Flash memory (as defined by FSIZE) are to be transferred. Continue reading indefinitely if FSIZE = 0x1F. DL\[0\] is stuck at 1 in dual-flash mode (DFM = 1) even when 0 is written to this bit, thus assuring that each access transfers an even number of bytes. This field has no effect when in memory-mapped mode (FMODE = 10). This field can be written only when BUSY = 0.
