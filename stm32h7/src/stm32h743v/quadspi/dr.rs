///Field `DATA` reader - Data Data to be sent/received to/from the external SPI device. In indirect write mode, data written to this register is stored on the FIFO before it is sent to the Flash memory during the data phase. If the FIFO is too full, a write operation is stalled until the FIFO has enough space to accept the amount of data being written. In indirect read mode, reading this register gives (via the FIFO) the data which was received from the Flash memory. If the FIFO does not have as many bytes as requested by the read operation and if BUSY=1, the read operation is stalled until enough data is present or until the transfer is complete, whichever happens first. In automatic polling mode, this register contains the last data read from the Flash memory (without masking). Word, halfword, and byte accesses to this register are supported. In indirect write mode, a byte write adds 1 byte to the FIFO, a halfword write 2, and a word write 4. Similarly, in indirect read mode, a byte read removes 1 byte from the FIFO, a halfword read 2, and a word read 4. Accesses in indirect mode must be aligned to the bottom of this register: a byte read must read DATA\[7:0\] and a halfword read must read DATA\[15:0\].
