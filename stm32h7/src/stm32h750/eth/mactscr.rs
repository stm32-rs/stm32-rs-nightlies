When this bit is set, received PTP packets with DA containing a special multicast or unicast address that matches the one programmed in MAC address registers are considered for processing as indicated below, when PTP is directly sent over Ethernet. For normal time stamping operation, MAC address registers 0 to 31 is considered for unicast destination address matching. For PTP offload, only MAC address register 0 is considered for unicast destination address matching.

When this bit is reset, the MAC ignores the timestamp status of current packet if the timestamp status of previous packet is not read by the software. The MAC indicates this by setting the TXTSSMIS bit of the (ETH_MACTXTSSNR).
