/**The receive and transmit FIFOs can be only read or written as word (32-bit) wide registers. The FIFOs contain 16 entries on sequential addresses. This allows the CPU to use its load and store multiple operands to read from/write to the FIFO.When accessing SDMMC_FIFOR with half word or byte access an AHB bus fault is generated.

You can [`read`](crate::Reg::read) this register and get [`fifor::R`](R). You can [`reset`](crate::Reg::reset), [`write`](crate::Reg::write), [`write_with_zero`](crate::Reg::write_with_zero) this register using [`fifor::W`](W). You can also [`modify`](crate::Reg::modify) this register. See [API](https://docs.rs/svd2rust/#read--modify--write-api).
