These bits can be written at any time, allowing dynamic fine-tuning of the PLL3 VCO. The software must set correctly these bits to insure that the VCO output frequency is between its valid frequency range, that is: 128 to 560Â MHz if PLL3VCOSEL = 0 150 to 420Â MHz if PLL3VCOSEL = 1 VCO output frequency = Fref3_ck x (DIVN3 + (FRACN3 / 213)), with DIVN3 between 8 and 420 FRACN3 can be between 0 and 213 - 1 The input frequency Fref3_ck must be between 1 and 16 MHz. In order to change the FRACN value on-the-fly even if the PLL is enabled, the application must proceed as follows: Set the bit PLL1FRACEN to 0. Write the new fractional value into FRACN1.
