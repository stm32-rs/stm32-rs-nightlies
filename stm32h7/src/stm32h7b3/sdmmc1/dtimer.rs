/**The SDMMC_DTIMER register contains the data timeout period, in card bus clock periods. A counter loads the value from the SDMMC_DTIMER register, and starts decrementing when the data path state machine (DPSM) enters the Wait_R or Busy state. If the timer reaches 0 while the DPSM is in either of these states, the timeout status flag is set.

You can [`read`](crate::Reg::read) this register and get [`dtimer::R`](R). You can [`reset`](crate::Reg::reset), [`write`](crate::Reg::write), [`write_with_zero`](crate::Reg::write_with_zero) this register using [`dtimer::W`](W).
