/**The interrupt mask register determines which status flags generate an interrupt request by setting the corresponding bit to 1.

You can [`read`](crate::Reg::read) this register and get [`maskr::R`](R). You can [`reset`](crate::Reg::reset), [`write`](crate::Reg::write), [`write_with_zero`](crate::Reg::write_with_zero) this register using [`maskr::W`](W). You can also [`modify`](crate::Reg::modify) this register. See [API](https://docs.rs/svd2rust/#read--modify--write-api).
