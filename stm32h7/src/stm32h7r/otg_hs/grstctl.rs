///Field `CSRST` reader - Core soft reset Resets the HCLK and PHY clock domains as follows: Clears the interrupts and all the CSR register bits except for the following bits: GATEHCLK bit in OTG_PCGCCTL STPPCLK bit in OTG_PCGCCTL FSLSPCS bits in OTG_HCFG DSPD bit in OTG_DCFG SDIS bit in OTG_DCTL OTG_GCCFG register All module state machines (except for the AHB slave unit) are reset to the Idle state, and all the transmit FIFOs and the receive FIFO are flushed. Any transactions on the AHB Master are terminated as soon as possible, after completing the last data phase of an AHB transfer. Any transactions on the USB are terminated immediately. The application can write to this bit any time it wants to reset the core. This is a self-clearing bit and the core clears this bit after all the necessary logic is reset in the core, which can take several clocks, depending on the current state of the core. Once this bit has been cleared, the software must wait at least 3 PHY clocks before accessing the PHY domain (synchronization delay). The software must also check that bit 31 in this register is set to 1 (AHB Master is Idle) before starting any operation. Typically, the software reset is used during software development and also when the user dynamically changes the PHY selection bits in the above listed USB configuration registers. When the user changes the PHY, the corresponding clock for the PHY is selected and used in the PHY domain. Once a new clock is selected, the PHY domain has to be reset for proper operation. Note: Accessible in both device and host modes.
