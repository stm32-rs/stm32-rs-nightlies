///Field `REP` reader - Repetition counter reload value This bitfield defines the update rate of the compare registers (i.e. periodic transfers from preload to active registers) when preload registers are enable. It also defines the update interrupt generation rate, if this interrupt is enable. When the repetition down-counter reaches zero, an update event is generated and it restarts counting from REP value. As the repetition counter is reloaded with REP value only at the repetition update event UEV, any write to the TIMx_RCR register is not taken in account until the next repetition update event. It means in PWM mode (REP+1) corresponds to: the number of PWM periods in edge-aligned mode the number of half PWM period in center-aligned mode.
