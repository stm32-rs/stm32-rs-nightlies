Full-Duplex mode: this bit should be read as 0 before writing to this register. To initiate a Pause packet, the application must set this bit to 1. During Control packet transfer, this bit continues to be set to indicate that a packet transmission is in progress. When Pause packet transmission is complete, the MAC resets this bit to 0. You should not write to this register until this bit is cleared. Half-duplex mode: When this bit is set (and TFE bit is set) in the Half-duplex mode, the MAC asserts the backpressure. During backpressure, when the MAC receives a new packet, the transmitter starts sending a JAM pattern resulting in a collision. When the MAC is configured for the Full-duplex mode, the BPA is automatically disabled.
