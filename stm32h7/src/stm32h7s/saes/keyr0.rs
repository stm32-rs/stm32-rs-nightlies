///Field `KEY` writer - Cryptographic key, bits \[31:0\] This write-only bitfield contains the bits \[31:0\] of the AES encryption or decryption key, depending on the operating mode: - In Mode 1 (encryption), Mode 2 (key derivation): the value to write into the bitfield is the encryption key. - In Mode 3 (decryption): the value to write into the bitfield is the encryption key to be derived before being used for decryption. The SAES_KEYRx registers may be written only when KEYSIZE value is correct and when the SAES peripheral is disabled (EN bit of the SAES_CR register cleared). A special writing sequence is also required, as described in KEYVALID bit of the SAES_SR register. Note that, if KEYSEL is different from 0 and KEYVALID = 0, the key is directly loaded to SAES_KEYRx registers (hence writes to key register is ignored and KEIF is set). Refer to Section 32.4.16: SAES key registers on page 1758 for more details.
