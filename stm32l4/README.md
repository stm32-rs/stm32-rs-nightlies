# stm32l4
This crate provides an autogenerated API for access to STM32L4 peripherals.
The API is generated using [svd2rust] with patched svd files containing
extensive type-safe support. For more information please see the [main repo].

Refer to the [documentation] for full details.

[svd2rust]: https://github.com/rust-embedded/svd2rust

[documentation]: https://docs.rs/stm32l4/latest/stm32l4/

## Usage
Each device supported by this crate is behind a feature gate so that you only
compile the device(s) you want. To use, in your Cargo.toml:

```toml
[dependencies.stm32l4]
version = "0.14.0"
features = ["stm32l412"]
```

The `rt` feature is enabled by default and brings in support for `cortex-m-rt`.
To disable, specify `default-features = false` in `Cargo.toml`.

In your code:

```rust
use stm32l4::stm32l412;

let mut peripherals = stm32l412::Peripherals::take().unwrap();
let gpioa = &peripherals.GPIOA;
gpioa.odr.modify(|_, w| w.odr0().set_bit());
```
