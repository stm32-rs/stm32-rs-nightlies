/**BSEC_OTP_SRLOCK0 is used to prevent reloading of BSEC_OTP_DATA0 to BSEC_OTP_DATA31 until next system-reset. BSEC_OTP_SRLOCK1 is used to prevent reloading of BSEC_OTP_DATA32 to BSEC_OTP_DATA63 until next system-reset. BSEC_OTP_SRLOCK2 is used to prevent reloading of BSEC_OTP_DATA64 to BSEC_OTP_DATA95 until next system-reset. Setting SRLOCK bits or attempt to reload a locked OTP do not clear the corresponding BSEC_OTP_DATAx shadow register. BSEC_OTP_SRLOCK0 bit 0 is controlled by hardware according to fuse_ok, writing to this bit has no effect.
