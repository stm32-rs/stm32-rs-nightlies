/**The length of the NTU is given by: NTU = CAN clock period x NC/DC. NC is an 18-bit value. Its high part, NCH\[17:16\] is hard wired to 0b01. Therefore the range of NC extends from 0x10000 to 0x1FFFF. The value configured by NCL is the initial value for FDCAN_TURNA.NAV\[15:0\]. DC is set to 0x1000 by hardware reset and it may not be written to 0x0000. Level 1: NC 4 * DC and NTU = CAN bit time Levels 0 and 2: NC 8 * DC The actual value of FDCAN_TUR may be changed by the clock drift compensation function of TTCAN level 0 and level 2 in order to adjust the node local view of the NTU to the time master view of the NTU. DC will not be changed by the automatic drift compensation, FDCAN_TURNA.NAV may be adjusted around NC in the range of the synchronization deviation limit given by FDCAN_TTOCF.LDSDL. NC and DC should be programmed to the largest suitable values in achieve the best computational accuracy for the drift compensation process.
