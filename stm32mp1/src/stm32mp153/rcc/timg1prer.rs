/**This register is used to control the prescaler value of timers located into APB1 domain. It concerns TIM2, TIM3, TIM4, TIM5, TIM6, TIM7, TIM12, TIM13 and TIM14. Refer to Section: Sub-system clock generation for additional information.

You can [`read`](crate::Reg::read) this register and get [`timg1prer::R`](R). You can [`reset`](crate::Reg::reset), [`write`](crate::Reg::write), [`write_with_zero`](crate::Reg::write_with_zero) this register using [`timg1prer::W`](W). You can also [`modify`](crate::Reg::modify) this register. See [API](https://docs.rs/svd2rust/#read--modify--write-api).
