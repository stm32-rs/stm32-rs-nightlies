/**The flags are set when one of the listed conditions is detected (edge-sensitive). The flags remain set until the Host clears them. A flag is cleared by writing a 1 to the corresponding bit position. Writing a 0 has no effect. A hard reset will clear the register. The configuration of CCU_IE controls whether an interrupt is generated or not.

You can [`read`](crate::Reg::read) this register and get [`ir::R`](R). You can [`reset`](crate::Reg::reset), [`write`](crate::Reg::write), [`write_with_zero`](crate::Reg::write_with_zero) this register using [`ir::W`](W). You can also [`modify`](crate::Reg::modify) this register. See [API](https://docs.rs/svd2rust/#read--modify--write-api).
