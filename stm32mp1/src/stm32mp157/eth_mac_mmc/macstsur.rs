/**The System Time Seconds Update register, along with the System Time Nanoseconds Update register, initializes or updates the system time maintained by the MAC. You must write both registers before setting the TSINIT or TSUPDT bits in ETH_MACTSCR register. This register is present only when the IEEE 1588 Timestamp feature is selected without external timestamp input.

You can [`read`](crate::Reg::read) this register and get [`macstsur::R`](R). You can [`reset`](crate::Reg::reset), [`write`](crate::Reg::write), [`write_with_zero`](crate::Reg::write_with_zero) this register using [`macstsur::W`](W). You can also [`modify`](crate::Reg::modify) this register. See [API](https://docs.rs/svd2rust/#read--modify--write-api).
