/**In Linked List mode, at the end of a block (single or last block in repeated block transfer mode), this register will be loaded from memory (from address given by current LAR\[31:0\] + 0x14). The new value is only taken into account after all registers are updated, for the next end of block.

You can [`read`](crate::Reg::read) this register and get [`c5lar::R`](R). You can [`reset`](crate::Reg::reset), [`write`](crate::Reg::write), [`write_with_zero`](crate::Reg::write_with_zero) this register using [`c5lar::W`](W). You can also [`modify`](crate::Reg::modify) this register. See [API](https://docs.rs/svd2rust/#read--modify--write-api).
