/**This register is used to control the selection of the kernel clock for the RNG1. Note that changing the clock source on-the-fly is allowed, and will not generate any timing violation, however the user has to ensure that both the previous and the new clock sources are present during the switching, and for the whole transition time. Refer to Section: Clock enabling delays. If TZEN = , this register can only be modified in secure mode.

You can [`read`](crate::Reg::read) this register and get [`rng1ckselr::R`](R). You can [`reset`](crate::Reg::reset), [`write`](crate::Reg::write), [`write_with_zero`](crate::Reg::write_with_zero) this register using [`rng1ckselr::W`](W). You can also [`modify`](crate::Reg::modify) this register. See [API](https://docs.rs/svd2rust/#read--modify--write-api).
