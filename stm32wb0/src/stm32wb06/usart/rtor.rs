In standard mode, the RTOF flag is set if, after the last received character, no new start bit is detected for more than the RTO value. In Smartcard mode, this value is used to implement the CWT and BWT. See Smartcard chapter for more details. In the standard, the CWT/BWT measurement is done starting from the start bit of the last received character. Note: This value must only be programmed once per received character.

This bitfield can be used also in other modes. In this case, the Block length counter is reset when RE=0 (receiver disabled) and/or when the EOBCF bit is written to 1. Note: This value can be programmed after the start of the block reception (using the data from the LEN character in the Prologue Field). It must be programmed only once per received block.
