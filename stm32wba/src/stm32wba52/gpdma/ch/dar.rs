///Field `DA` reader - destination address This field is the pointer to the address from which the next data is written. During the channel activity, depending on the destination addressing mode (GPDMA_CxTR1.DINC), this field is kept fixed or incremented by the data width (GPDMA_CxTR1.DDW_LOG2\[21:0\]) after each burst destination data, reflecting the next address from which data is written. During the channel activity, this address is updated after each completed destination burst, consequently to: the programmed destination burst; either in fixed addressing mode or in contiguous-data incremented mode. If contiguously incremented (GPDMA_CxTR1.DINC = 1), then the additional address offset value is the programmed burst size, as defined by GPDMA_CxTR1.DBL_1\[5:0\] and GPDMA_CxTR1.DDW_LOG2\[1:0\] the additional destination incremented/decremented offset value as programmed by GPDMA_CxBR1.DDEC. In linked-list mode, after a LLI data transfer is completed, this register is automatically updated by the GPDMA from the memory, provided the LLI is set with GPDMA_CxLLR.UDA = 1. Note: A destination address must be aligned with the programmed data width of a destination burst (DA\[2:0\] versus GPDMA_CxTR1.DDW_LOG2\[1:0\]). Else, a user setting error is reported and no transfer is issued.
